This is a modified version of the wonderful xplot program, written by
Tim Shepard at MIT.

Tim is busy working on other things and hasn't been able to devote
time to xplot, so the tcptrace project has adopted the program in
order to keep it useful for tcptrace users by applying bug fixes as
necessary.  Anything that works correctly and/or looks nice is Tim's
work.  Most bugs are likely ours!
